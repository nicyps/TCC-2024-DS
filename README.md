## **Final Project in the Systems Development course**

My Final Project (TCC) in Systems Development in Brazil, at Etec (Centro Paula Souza). Together with three teammates, we developed a website for our schoolâ€™s Agricultural Cooperative. The website, in addition to having its own database, includes features such as report visualization, employee and inventory management, product reservations for customers, and a well-designed CRUD system to meet the cooperative's needs.
This was my final project for the Systems Development course. One note: the file names are in Brazilian Portuguese.
