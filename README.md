## **Final Project in the Systems Development course**

My Final Project (TCC) in Systems Development in Brazil, at Etec (Centro Paula Souza). Together with three teammates, we developed a website for our schoolâ€™s Agricultural Cooperative. The website, in addition to having its own database, includes features such as report visualization, employee and inventory management, product reservations for customers, and a well-designed CRUD system to meet the cooperative's needs.

### Notes
_The project has many folders and files, due to the use of libraries and functions with PHP, so I will be uploading the .zip folder (complete) and just making the index.html, style.css and the database template available here._
